The very first difficulty we faced was downloading pygame. We're used to downloading programs with a click of a button, but we had to learn how to use the command prompt on both MacOS and Windows in order to install pygame.

All other difficulties were simply solved with readjustments with the either code or graphics, but the last hurdle was adding a scoring system. We wanted to created a scoring system based on how long time that the player stayed alive. But, we had trouble implementing a running clock into the game. So the score increases by 1 as the game runs, and the highest score is stored, regardless of whether the game is restarted or not.

Overall, we enjoyed creating an entertaining video game by only using Python and Photoshop. It shows even the biggest projects can come from the simplest things.
