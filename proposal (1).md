A software will be used to entertain a user while promoting the candied fruit business. We will allow users to play a game similar to papa's pizzeria and games where the users are making things for customers. So they will be given a picture of a type of candy they need to create and they will have a set of ingredients that they can use to replicate the image of the customer's desired candy. The customers presented will be cartoon like animals. Finally, at the end of each level an ad will pop up with the business's info. The execution will be researched into still.

We need to find out the best programming language to create games, how to add royalty free music to a game, and figure out the platform that we are gonna be able to play the game on. How to add a pop up ad at the end of the game. We can divide the tasks such as finding the music, images, etc. Coding will be done together.
